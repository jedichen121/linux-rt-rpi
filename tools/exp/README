# Experiments folder for rt blocking

This folder contains the test programs code and cgroup setup scripts.

## Cgroup setup scripts

The three `.sh` files setup three sibing cgroups with the same parent. The cgroups is two level depth to simulate docker container structure.  

* cg1.sh: Setup the first cgroup, assign a window time for this group. This is the group to run the protected task.
* cg2.sh & cg3.sh: Set up the second and third cgroup. Does not assign window time. Background programs should run in these cgroups.


## Test program codes

* test_syscall.cpp: a simple task to test if the new syscall is setup correctly.
* pause_syscall.cpp: a periodic fifo task that calls the blocking syscall periodically. Compile with -lrt.
* fifo_task.c: a non-stoping fifo task.
